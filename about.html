<h2>$whoami</h2>



<p>
My name is Melvin Karuga. I am currently studying information security at Cal Poly Pomona. 
I am continuously learning about the IT world, specifically the security side of things. 
I also have the honor of being on the executive board of SWIFT, or Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology. 
Ultimately, I want to broad my knowledge of the cybersecurity world, but also collaborate with those who also have a passion for technology as well.

This blog is meant to document my discoveres and progress; whether I am going through the steps of a techincal walkthrough, or analyzing my thoughts on a certain topic, 
I want this information to be all stored in one place so I can keep track of my own progress, but also showcase this to anyone interested. Please enjoy your stay.
